Welcome to Simulated Tile Logic!

To begin, run the .bat file. If it does not run, edit the file and delete the word 'python'
Do NOT delete anything else.

To place a tile, use the left mouse button.
To delete, use the right.
To pan/zoom, use the middle.

To rotate the placement, use the Q and E keys; Q for c-clockwise, E for clockwise.

To run or stop running the simulation, press space. 
You will be unable to place or destroy tiles when the sim is running.

STlogic is a logic sim with 7 tiles, which can be selected with the number keys:
1) Wire     This is the simplest; when it receives input, it outputs on the opposite side.
2) Split    When it receives input, it outputs on the other three sides.
3) Bridge   Acts like a wire in two directions without interference.
4) Not      When it does not receive input, it outputs, and vice versa.
5) And      When it receives two inputs, it outputs; otherwise, it does not.
6) Input    When clicked and the sim is running, it outputs until it is clicked again.
7) Output   This can only turn on and does not output, contrary to its name.

To undo a placement/deletion/running, press CTRL + Z
To redo a placement/deletion/running, press CTRL + Y

To save your work, press CTRL + S, then type your preffered name into the terminal.
To load a save, press CTRL + O, then type your saved name into the terminal.
Once defining whtat save you are on, just press CTRL + S to save.

Also, you can change the tile area of a save by going to the file and changing the 
numbers either side the hash (#): width#height

This took too long to make, so please show your support for this in any way possible.
