Welcome to Simulated Tile Logic!

To begin, run the .bat file. If it does not run, edit the file and delete the word 'python'
Do NOT delete anything else.

There are three modes:


1) Build 

To place a tile, use the left mouse button.
To delete, use the right.
To pan/zoom, use the middle.

STlogic is a logic sim with 7 tiles, which can be selected using the number keys:
1) Wire     This is the simplest; when it receives input, it outputs on the opposite side.
2) Split    When it receives input, it outputs on the other three sides.
3) Bridge   Acts like a wire in two directions without interference.
4) Not      When it does not receive input, it outputs, and vice versa.
5) And      When it receives two inputs, it outputs; otherwise, it does not.
6) Input    When clicked and the sim is running, it outputs until it is clicked again.
7) Output   This can only turn on and does not output, contrary to its name.

To undo a placement/deletion, press CTRL + Z
To redo a placement/deletion, press CTRL + Y

To rotate the placement, use the Q and E keys; Q for c-clockwise, E for clockwise.

To run or stop running the simulation, press space.
The tiles will behave as stated in the above section.
